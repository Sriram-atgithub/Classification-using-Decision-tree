## Decision tree

A decision tree is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm, which is utilized for both classification and regression tasks. It has a hierarchical, tree structure, which consists of a root node, branches, internal nodes, and leaf nodes.

Using this algorithm, we are going to predict the flower species.

## How decision trees work
Decision trees work in a step-wise manner, meaning that they perform a step-by-step process instead of following a continuous process. Decision trees follow a tree-like structure, where the nodes of a tree are split using the features based on defined criteria. The main criteria based on which decision trees split are:

**Gini impurity:** Measures the impurity in a node.

**Entropy:** Measures the randomness of the system.

**Variance:** This is normally used in the Regression model, which is a measure of the variation of each data point from the mean.
